# AACR Protocol (Adapted Application Communication and Routing)

## What is this?
This is a college proyect, I was tasked to create a TCP based protocol for simple communication. Thus AACR (Adapted Application Communication and Routing) was created. This protocol comes with a way to create routes similar to HTTP. The messages are passed using a JSON.

## How to make something with it
You can edit the ```main.py``` to basically make anything with a route.  

## To run use
  ```
  py main.py
  ```
  
  ```
  py client_example.py
  ```
